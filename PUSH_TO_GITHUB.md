# 🚀 Push to GitHub - Step by Step

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. **Open your browser** and go to: https://github.com/new

2. **Fill in the form:**
   - Repository name: `ar-museum-guide`
   - Description: `AI-Powered AR Museum Guide with Knowledge Grounding - Final Year Engineering Project`
   - Choose: **Public** ✅
   - **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT check any boxes (no README, no .gitignore, no license)
   
3. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Copy and Run These Commands

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you some commands. **Ignore those** and run these instead:

```bash
cd F:\PROJECT\ar-museum-guide
git push -u origin main
```

That's it! Everything else is already set up.

## Authentication

When git asks for credentials:
- **Username**: gowsrini2004
- **Password**: Use a Personal Access Token (NOT your GitHub password)
  - Get token here: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
  - Give it a name like "ar-museum-guide"
  - Select scope: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
  - Click "Generate token"
  - Copy the token and paste it as password

## After Pushing

Your repository will be at:
**https://github.com/gowsrini2004/ar-museum-guide**

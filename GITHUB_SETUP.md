# Automated GitHub Push Script

## Your Git Configuration ✅
- Name: Gowtham S
- Email: gowsrini2004@gmail.com

## What You Need to Do

### Option 1: If you have a GitHub account
1. Tell me your GitHub username
2. I'll run the commands
3. You'll authenticate when prompted

### Option 2: Create new GitHub account (if you don't have one)
1. Go to https://github.com/signup
2. Use email: gowsrini2004@gmail.com
3. Choose a username (e.g., "gowsrini" or "gowtham-s")
4. Tell me the username

## Commands I'll Run (after you provide username)

```bash
# Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ar-museum-guide.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

When git asks for credentials, you'll need to provide:
- **Username**: Your GitHub username
- **Password**: Use a Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password)
  - Get token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
  - Or use GitHub Desktop for easier authentication

---

**Just tell me your GitHub username and I'll execute the push!**
